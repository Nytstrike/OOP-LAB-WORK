// Create a class that includes a data member that holds a �serial number� for each object created from the class.
// That is, the first object created will be numbered 1, the second 2, and so on. To do this, you�ll need another data
// member that records a count of how many objects have been created so far. (This member should apply to the
// class as a whole; not to individual objects. What keyword specifies this?) Then, as each object is created, its
// constructor can examine this count member variable to determine the appropriate serial number for the new
// object.
// Add a member function that permits an object to report its own serial number. Then write a main() program that
// creates three objects and queries each one about its serial number. They should respond I am object number 2, and
// so on.
