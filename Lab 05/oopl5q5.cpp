// Keeping in mind our previous car example, write a class that represents a car, and use aggregation and
// composition to combine different components like engine, wheels, headlights and steering to create the
// car object.
// Hint: create the individual classes first before performing the composition. Remember
// that for aggregation, you will need pointers! Youâ€™ll be needing constructors and setters to
// set these values in case of aggregation. Same hint applies to other questions.
